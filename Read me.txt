1) please ignore whether or not the formula is correct, they are wrong but that was an early example i tried to by myself to test my skills. 
2) Note that i haven't included all the "else if" options therefore there are logical mistakes..!
3) on this software i am trying to show the GUI
4) also i am showing that if they leave one text field empty the code can jump to another formula..!
5) i can fix the logic if required.. just by adding all the options
6) the drop downlists, the check boxes and the radio buttons are not doing anything on this programm but now i know how to activate them
